Solve the coursework using Java as programming language. You are not to use any GUI tools.

Questions
This exercise demonstrates the use of table, different GUI components (buttons, text fields, radio button, check box) and menus.

The program contains two parts. The left part has a table (JTable) inserted into a JScrollPane. The table displays details entered on the right part. 

The right part contains text fields to enter first name, second name (last name) and phone number. It also contains a check box to denote the phone number entered is a private number or not. The values entered in the text fields are displayed in the table once the “Add” button is clicked. Pressing “Remove” button removes the selected record from the table. Pressing “Clear” button removes the contents typed in the text fields and resets the check box. Pressing “Search” button should display a message dialog that says “Search functionality will be supported in the professional version”.

User should also be able to sort the table details based on “firstname, lastname” or “lastname, firstname” by selecting corresponding radio button.

There should be three menus namely, “File”, “Edit” and “Help”. File menu should have “Exit” menu item, which when pressed should close the application.

Edit menu should have “Clear”, “Search”, “Add” and “Remove” menu items. Each of these menu items should function in the same manner as their corresponding buttons. Add mnemonics and relevant tool tips for each of the menu items.

Help menu should have “About” menu item, which when pressed should display “It is still in trial version!!”
